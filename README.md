# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

CSS Styling

- Type writer effect: https://codepen.io/nodws/pen/ByBVMoG
- 2025 Progress Bar effect: https://codepen.io/gambhirsharma/pen/dPbevaJ

# Ideas:

- I want to create a real time typing effect, where when the page loads, everything also loads in real time as if some is typing it in real-time.
